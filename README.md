# Airfoil Noise Prediction #
This project is a part of the AAI-510 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD). 


-- Project Status: Completed

## Installation ##
To begin using this project clone the repo using the instructions from below. Once cloned you'll need to update the path to the CSV in the Python code in order to get it to run as the location will vary based on the local machine.

` git init `

`git clone https://github.com/sglasher/Team4ML.git`

### Required Python Packages ###
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `os`
- `sklearn`

## Project Intro/Objective ##
The goal of this project was to create a model that will be able to accurately predict the SSPL, or Self-Noise, level of an airfoil given a specfic set of feature values. Using NASA's AirFoil Self-Noise Dataset, we were able to achieve an R2 score of 0.92 with a Random Forest model.
